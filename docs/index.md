# :simple-owasp: Amass Docs 

**OWASP Amass** is an open-source, versatile **attack surface intelligence** framework designed to comprehensively map an organizationâ€™s footprint. Built for flexibility and depth, Amass combines advanced data collection, network mapping, and OSINT capabilities to deliver detailed insights into physical and digital assets. 

## Overview

[OWASP Amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass) extends **far beyond basic subdomain enumeration**, offering a comprehensive, automated approach to information gathering that reveals the full scope of an entity's **physical** and **digital** footprint.


??? info "Open Asset Model (OAM)"
    The [Open Asset Model](https://owasp-amass.github.io/docs/open-asset-model/) expands traditional specifications by modeling both the **physical** and **digital** structure of a target's asset landscape. Defining **asset types**, their unique **properties**, and the **relationships** that join them, the `OAM` compiles a comprehensive view of the attack surface from an adversarial perspective.

- **Automated Deployment and Enumeration:** Easily deploy Amass with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for quick, automated asset discovery across multiple domains with minimal configuration.

- **Centralized Asset Management with Asset Database:** Use the Asset Database for storing, managing, and retrieving discovered assets, with support for long-term tracking and consistent data collection via the Open Asset Model.

- **Scalable and Flexible Infrastructure:** Designed for enterprise environments, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) enables scalable deployments of Amass, ensuring consistent attack surface management for organizations of any size.

## :octicons-tools-16: Getting Started 

Users have several options when installing the Amass framework.

### Build from Source Code

Install the Amass swiss army knife executable in your preferred environment.

#### Prerequisites

- **Golang:** Install an up-to-date version of Go on your system. You can download it from the [Go Official Website](https://go.dev).

#### Perform the build and installation process

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v5/cmd/amass@main
```

At this point, the binary should be in *$GOPATH/bin*.

#### Install with Libpostal for Street Address Parsing

**On Ubuntu/Debian**
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl autoconf make automake libtool pkg-config
```

**On CentOS/RHEL**
```bash
sudo yum install curl autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig
```

**On MacOS**
```bash
sudo brew install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```

**Installing libpostal**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal.git
cd libpostal
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --datadir=[...some dir with a few GB of space...]
make
sudo make install
```

On Linux it's probably a good idea to run.
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

Now, build OWASP Amass with libpostal compiled in for street address parsing.

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v5/cmd/amass@main
```

At this point, the binary should be in *$GOPATH/bin*.

### Install using Homebrew

The OWASP Amass Project maintains a **Homebrew** package.

#### Prerequisites

- **Homebrew:** Intall an up-to-date version of the package manager on your system. You can download it from the [Homebrew Official Website](https://brew.sh/).

#### Perform the build and installation process

The following two commands will install Amass into your environment:

```bash
brew tap owasp-amass/homebrew-amass
brew install amass
```

### Containerized Execution within Docker Compose

Follow these steps to set up Amass using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker:** Up-to-date intallation running on your system. You can download it from the [Docker Official Website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
  
- **Docker Compose:** Typically, Docker Compose is bundled with Docker Desktop, but you can verify the installation or install it seperately from
    [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- **Git:** To clone the Amass repository. Download it from the [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

#### Step 1: Clone the Amass Docker Compose Directory

Start by cloning the OWASP Amass repository containing the Docker Compose setup files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass-docker-compose.git
mv amass-docker-compose amass   # Optional: Rename the directory to something shorter (e.g., amass)
cd amass   # Navigate to the local repository
```

#### Step 2: Configure the Compose Environment

**> Open the `assetdb.env` File:**

Navigate to the `config` directory and open the `assetdb.env` file in a text editor to set the database passwords.

```bash
cd config
nano assetdb.env # (1)!
```

1.   You can replace `nano` with your preferred text editor, like `vim` or `code` for Visual Studio Code.


**> Set the Passwords:** 

In the `assetdb.env` file, locate the lines for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `AMASS_PASSWORD`. Update them to assign new values. 

For example:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD= your_new_postgres_password
AMASS_PASSWORD= your_new_amass_password
```

!!! Warning
    This cannot be performed after you start the Docker Compose and the database has been created.

**> Save Changes:** 

After editing, save the file:

- If you're using **nano**: Press `Ctrl + O` (then hit `Enter`) to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

- If you're using **vim**: Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter`.


**> Modify the `config.yaml` File:**

Open the `config.yaml` file to set the database password to the one you just assigned as `AMASS_PASSWORD`.

```bash
nano config.yaml
```

**> Update the Database Password:** 

Find the section in the `config.yaml` file that specifies the database settings. Change the password to match the `AMASS_PASSWORD` you set earlier.

For example:

```yaml
options:
  ...
  database: "postgres://amass:password@assetdb:5432/assetdb"
```

**> Save Changes:**

As before, save the changes using your preferred text editor.


!!! info "Update the Data Sources"
    If you want to configure data sources, you can modify the `datasources.yaml` file. Open it with:
    ```bash
    nano datasources.yaml
    ```
    Uncomment the lines you need, and provide any necessary credentials.

#### Step 3: Building the Docker Images

Your **Amass** framework is now configured and ready to be built. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) will build the required images and start them correctly when you perform your first Amass command execution.

**> Type the following to get started:**

```bash
docker compose run --rm enum -active -d example.org # (1)!
```

1.   If the build process times out, simply execute the command again to resume.


#### :material-update: Update Process for the Compose Environment

**> Make the local repo your current working directory:**

```bash
cd amass
```

**> Shutdown the Amass containers within the Docker environment:**

```bash 
docker compose down
```

**> Backup the configuration files:**

```bash 
cp config/assetdb.env config/config.yaml config/datasources.yaml backups/
```

**> Backup the following directories: `assetdb` , `data` , `logs`.**

**> Update the local repo:**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### :material-update: Update Process for the Docker Images

**> Make the local repo your current working directory:**
```bash
cd amass
```

**> Shutdown the Amass containers within the Docker environment:**

```bash
docker compose down
```

**> Update components from their GitHub repos:**

```bash
docker compose build --pull --no-cache
```
